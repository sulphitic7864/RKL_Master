Creation Of The Regional Basketball League (RKL) Mobile Application

Team:
Eitvidas Šemežys (Fontys ICT Student)
Lukas Rutkauskas (RKL Media Manager)

Introduction:
Regional Basketball League (RKL) is the third strongest basketball league in Lithuania. Since
Remigijus Kuodis has become the director of the league in 2022, the 
increasingly growing in popularity due to their innovations and marketing.
Client:

Regionų Krepšinio Lyga (EN.: Regional Basketball League)
Target From The Client:

Mobile application that features all (or most) of the information that is available in their Website
(https://www.rkl.lt/) made from A to Z.

Problems:
• Currently, there is no mobile application, or concept existing.

Restrictions:
• Time restraint from school.

Similar Products:
• Nederlandse Basketball Bond (Netherlands Basketball Bond) has a mobile application
that is the primary source of their information all means basketball, since I use it daily, I
know what limitations it has and what I could improve on taking inspiration out of this
application to make a better one for RKL. It is an account-based application that gives
personalised data to the user. While I do like the idea of personalised content and an
account based system, for RKL, I believe it is simply not the right approach because it is
more of a professional league rather than an organisation containing all basketball in the
country. I am going to include a lot of information in a neat and organised manner. See
more information about my approach and functionalities in the Software Design
Document.

Scope:
• Since it is a personal passion project, I do take my own personal time that is not
supposed to be allocated for school to continue working on this project overtime.
Because of this, I have already made everything I had in scope for the sprint (news tab
which was mentioned to be the end goal at first). Therefore, I will be creating the full
application, or at least try to, before the end of the semester, I will go downwards in the
MoSCoW table from must to could to would and so on so I firstly will have all the
essentials. I will not focus on UI/UX apart from the mandatory of course, since that is
what is going to be the goal for me for the next semester.
